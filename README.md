## Answers:

- I have spent around 8 hours for this assignment.
- I like the features because each feature is different and gave me unique experience. It made me think different possible methods to handle features. The use case is easy to read and understand.
- I did not like the search feature applied only for task description. Would be nice to apply search feature for more input fields
- It would be nice to have the total time spent on a task per day/month
- If i had more time, i would improve clean coding - use more concrete variable names and functions that use intelligent task
- i would implement unit testing for the frontend with jest and enzyme and backend with Mocha
- I would also deploy both frontend and backend on the server like heroku or netlify.
- i would implement above nice to have features.
- i would also implement UI/UX with styled components or Material UI
- My pagination and Date and time feature need improvement
- I am satisfied with the feature 1.The ability to book time without the tracker and 2.The ability to book time directly from the tracker
